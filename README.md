# HiLatte 
## What's HiLatte?
**HiLatte** is a simple starter repo for creating node service or web app. So why is this repo exists? this repo might be a good start for creating Node apps better than start it from scratch, so again why it could? it's because you don't have to think about the structure about folding, separating routes, controller, and views.

## How to use?
So here's a basic installation that you need
** NOTES: You need to create _.env_ file before running the file **

* Clone this repo
* Run >**npm install**< in the root folder
* create **.env** file by rename **.env.example** file or copy and create a new file, set DEBUG_MODE to true and **debug** helpers will showing logs in console
* After installation successful, you might see log message on the console, type localhost:3000 on your browser
* Done, you'll see the starting template app with the default routes

## Folder structure
Inside the **src** folder you'll see a few folders,
What you need to do is just adding a controller, routes, and views for basic use.. for more you might want to change the rest like adding new helpers on *utils* folder, or adding new core system in **core** folder inside **src** folder

## Update Log
